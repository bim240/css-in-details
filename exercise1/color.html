                    Primarily there are four ways to apply color within CSS: Keywords, hexadecimal, RGB and HSL values. Probably we all know that all the colors are a combination of RGB(red, green, blue). So all the four ways are the just the representation of RGB colors. By mixing different shades of RGB colors we can create millions of colors.

                    Let's discuss all these four ways one by one.

                    We have been using this approach from the beginning. Keyword values are just to say the name of color which you want to set within CSS. For example, red, blue, green, black, gray, etc there are a lot more keyword values which we can apply.
                    Although it seems simple to use keyword values, it may get difficult to remember the name of all the colors. That's why we have other options also like hexadecimal, RGB, and HSL.
