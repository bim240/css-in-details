                Last day we have seen the three types of selectors, type, class, and ID. Each selector has a specific weight in CSS. In the specificity table, type selector has the lowest weight, class selectors has medium weight and ID selector has the highest weight. Let's have a look at the table and the point how much each selector hold.

In the specificity table, type selector has the lowest weight, class selectors has medium weight and ID selector has the highest weight. Let's have a look at the table and the point how much each selector hold.
                The important point to note here is that the ID selector has higher specificity weight than the class selector and the class selector has higher specificity weight than the type selector. It means that if an element is selected and styled in a stylesheet using these selectors, then the selector holding more specific point in the table will always get the priority. The higher the specific weight more superiority is given in the stylesheet. Let's understand this with examples.

                    We have seen how all the three selectors work individually, now let's see how they can be used together. To be very specific sometimes we combine the selectors. Let's see a few examples, how do we combine the selectors.
                    Now, if we select the paragraph element using just type selector, it will select each and every paragraph element in the document. So to become more specific we can combine the selector.
