                    We have a number of options when it comes to using a browser. We have Chrome, Safari, Opera, Firefox, etc. For a user it's fine, he/she can use any browser. But being a developer its not like that, while coding you need to take care of all the browser out there. Because every browser has default styles for different elements. For example, the way a Chrome browser will display heading elements, in a similar way safari won't. Whatever margin and padding are having for different elements inside Firefox, it may be different in opera.

                    Being a web developer you'll always want to target your all user. Not just the Chrome or Firefox user. You'll always want to show similar styles to all the user for your websites. To ensure cross-browser similarities CSS resets is widely used. CSS resets takes all the element and provides unified styles for all browser. It removes all the default sizing, margin, padding and all the additional styles from the element.
                    
                    There are a bunch of CSS resets, and each has their own styles. One of the most popular is Eric Meyer’s reset.
