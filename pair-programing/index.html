                    <h2>What is Full Stack Developer?</h2>
                    <p>
                        A full-stack web developer is a technology expert who can work on both in the front end as well the back-end of any application. The person should be familiar with each layer of a 3-tier model. The 3-tier consists of

                        The presentation layer ( Main front end portion which deals with the user interface),
                        Business Logic Layer (back-end portion of any application which deals with data validation)
                        Database Layer
                        A Full-Stack Developer doesn't necessarily master of all technologies. However, the professional is expected to work on the client as well as server sides and understand what is going on when developing an application. He or she should have a genuine interest in all software technologies.

                    <h2>Myths about the Full Stack Engineer</h2>
                    <p>
                        Myth: Full stack developer is writing all types of code themselves.

                        Fact: He or she might know different technologies but not writing each code.
                        
                        Myth: Write both frontend and backend codes.
                        
                        Some full stack developers might code entire websites if they are working as a freelancer. But this its not a given that they mandatorily write both front and backend code.
                        
                        Full Stack Developer is "jack of all trade, master on none".
                        
                        No, FSD is master of a few stacks and comfortable with the rest. In fact working as a Full stack engineer gives you a 360 degree view into different components that make a software product successful. Due to this awareness, a Full Stack Developer can rapidly create a prototype compared to a backend or frontend engineer. Their viewpoints on product design and architecture are very pointed and helpful.
                        
                        Myth: You can't become full stack developer if you work for an Outsourcing company
                        
                        It is a mindset, not a position. In order to become full stack developer all, you need a right combination of technical knowledge.
